###### Detecting the Presence of ENF Signal in Digital Videos: a Superpixel based Approach
In this paper, a superpixel based ENF detection algorithm for video is presented.
Short video clips of about 2 minutes-length and can be used.
The algorithm is able to operate independently of the source camera sensor type, CCD or CMOS and achieves a very high ENF signal presence detection accuracy for videos captured by both sensor types.
90% true positive rate with 5% False positive rate. Full ROC curve in article.

###### Feasibility of using Electrical Network Frequency fluctuations to perform forensic digital audio authentication
C-program combined with a probe can be used to build the reference database.
Short-Time Fourier Transform method is intended for the ENF extraction of longer signals while our novel proposed use of the Autoregressive parametric method and our implementation of the zero-crossing approach tackle the case of shorter recordings. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed to facilitate the process of extracting the ENF fluctuations. The whole process is tested and evaluated for various scenarios ranging from long to short recordings.

###### Time-of-recording estimation for audio recordings. 
For example, compared with the recent DMA algorithm, our method achieves a relative error rate decrease of 86.86% (from 20.32% to 2.67%) and a speedup of 45× faster search response (41.0444 s versus 0.8973 s).
