* Assisted or semi-automated terrain perspective match: given an outline of some mountain shapes and a bounding box, can the place and perspective be determined?
* Create an open source package for chrono-locating a audio/video source by matching electrical network frequency variations (from low frequency hums in source audio) with recorded variations in a grid frequency database (i.e. https://osf.io/m43tg/). This sort of thing is theoretically possible (tons of IEEE articles about it) and reportedly in use by the FBI/foreign FBI equivalents, but is it practical for others? I don't know! To my knowledge, no one has publicly developed a public, non-academic proof-of-concept of this.
