# open-questions

These are difficult, long-term projects that would contribute to open source investigations at Bellingcat and for other investigators around the world. 

* Assisted or semi-automated terrain perspective match: from a photograph containing topographic features, can the location and view angle be determined? Topographic features could be traced from the image manually. An approximate geographic bounding box could be required to constrain the search space.
* Create an open source package for chrono-locating a audio/video source by matching electrical network frequency variations (from low frequency hums in source audio) with recorded variations in a grid frequency database (i.e. https://osf.io/m43tg/). This is theoretically possible (lots of IEEE articles about it) and reportedly in use by state-level justice entities, but is it practical for the OSINT hobbyist? To my knowledge, no one has publicly developed a public, non-academic proof-of-concept of this.
